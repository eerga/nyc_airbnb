Airbnb and tourist destination

For this short project, we identified top 5 most popular tourist destinations in NYC and used the google distance API (Distance Matrix API) to determine 
the distance between these locations and the 10 zip codes in the panel data. 
Analyze whether distance to these tourist locations is a significant factor in determining whether 
a zip code eventually contains significant Airbnb activity.  This does not have to be done through statistical methods. 

To support our claim, we used a secondary data source of your choosing to provide further evidence and details 
regarding the reasons why Airbnb becomes more popular in one neighborhood and not another neighborhood
